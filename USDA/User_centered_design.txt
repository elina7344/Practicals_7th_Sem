PROBLEM STATEMENT:
New mums need a way to connect with other 
mums because they are often at home alone during the day and feel isolated and alone.

PROCEDURE:
Design thinking is a non-linear, iterative process that teams use to understand users, challenge assumptions, 
redefine problems and create innovative solutions to prototype and test. Design teams use design 
thinking to tackle ill-defined/unknown problems (aka wicked problems) 
because they can reframe these in human-centric ways and focus on whatâ€™s most important for users.
